Compare two strings by comparing the sum of their letter-Values (char-Value).
For comparing treat all letters as UpperCase.

Empty and null-Strings should be treated as they are equal.
If the string contains other characters than letters, treat the whole string as it would be empty.

Examples:

"AD","BC" -> equal

"AD","DD" -> not equal

"gf","FG" -> equal

"zz1","" -> equal

"ZzZz", "ffPFF" -> equal

"kl", "lz" -> not equal

null, "" -> equal
